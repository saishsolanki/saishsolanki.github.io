# Offensive Security Portfolio

This is a starter template for your personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Push these files:** Commit and push the `index.html` and `style.css` files to your `saishsolanki/saishsolanki.github.io` repository.
2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
    *   Navigate to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar.
    *   Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and click **Save**.
3.  **View your site:** Your portfolio will be live at `https://saishsolanki.github.io` in a few minutes.
4.  **Customize:** Edit the `index.html` file to add your personal information, skills, and project details.

## Next Steps

*   **Add Project Details:** Create separate pages for detailed project write-ups or link to your GitHub repositories.
*   **Start a Blog:** Consider using a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to easily add a blog for CTF write-ups, vulnerability research, or tool analyses.
*   **Add a Custom Domain:** You can configure a custom domain name for your site in the GitHub Pages settings.
