# Cybersecurity Education Game

## Project Overview

The Cybersecurity Education Game is an innovative interactive learning platform designed to bridge the gap between theoretical cybersecurity knowledge and practical application. Developed during my time at Goa College of Engineering, this project aimed to make cybersecurity education more engaging and accessible to students and professionals.

## Problem Statement

Traditional cybersecurity education often relies on static content and theoretical examples, making it challenging for learners to:

- Understand real-world application of security concepts
- Retain complex technical information
- Develop practical skills in a safe environment
- Stay engaged throughout the learning process

## Solution Architecture

### Game Design Framework

The game follows a progressive learning model with multiple scenarios and difficulty levels:

1. **Beginner Level**: Basic security awareness
2. **Intermediate Level**: Technical implementation scenarios
3. **Advanced Level**: Complex threat analysis and response

### Technical Implementation

```python
# Example: Phishing Detection Module
class PhishingDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.suspicious_indicators = [
            'urgent_action_required',
            'suspicious_sender',
            'grammatical_errors',
            'suspicious_links'
        ]
    
    def analyze_email(self, email_content):
        risk_score = 0
        detected_indicators = []
        
        for indicator in self.suspicious_indicators:
            if self.check_indicator(email_content, indicator):
                risk_score += self.get_indicator_weight(indicator)
                detected_indicators.append(indicator)
        
        return {
            'risk_score': risk_score,
            'indicators': detected_indicators,
            'recommendation': self.get_recommendation(risk_score)
        }
```

## Key Features
